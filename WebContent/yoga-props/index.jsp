				<p>
				Props can be fantastic in promoting good alignment and a positive yoga experience for mind and body.

				<h2>Yoga Mats or Sticky Mats</h2>
				<p>
				Yoga Mats or Sticky Mats provide a thinly-cushioned, non-slip surface for practicing poses. Their sticky surface can be easily cleaned, and they roll up for easy storage and toting.   
				</p>
				
				<h2>Yoga Blocks</h2>
				<p>
				Yoga Blocks allow you to stay in proper form, even if your strength and flexibility levels don't. Blocks are rectangular-shaped, allowing you to use them at three different heights, depending on your needs. An example: using a block to reach the floor in a forward bend or behind the back leg in Triangle pose. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Wedges</h2>
				<p>
				Wedges are triangular shaped (think: door stop) but much wider and softer. They provide extra support and prevent overstretching while sitting (underneath the hips), standing and squatting (underneath heels), and when your weight is in your hands (underneath palm/wrist). 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Yoga Straps</h2>
				<p>
				Yoga Straps can help you stay in a pose longer and in better form. They can be used for seated stretches (around the feet in a forward bend) and one-legged standing poses (placing the strap around foot to aid in lifting or reaching your limb). Straps are also great for general flexibility training.
