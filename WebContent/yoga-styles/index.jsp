				<h2>Ashtanga yoga or Power Yoga</h2> 
				<p> 
				Ashtanga yoga or Power Yoga is a fast-paced, intense yoga style. It focuses on constant movement from one pose to the next. While most other forms of yoga slowly move from one asana to another, in Ashtanga yoga one pose leads to the next. This is a great style for people who are physically fit and strong.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Bikram or Hot yoga</h2>
				<p> 
				Bikram or Hot yoga is practiced in an environment where the temperature is 95-100 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a rather vigorous form of yoga.  The asanas are done in a specific succession for healing the human body. 
				
				<h2>Hatha Yoga </h2>
				<p>
				Hatha Yoga was introduced by Yogi Swatmarama, a 15th century Hindu sage.  Today’s classes generally offer basic yoga poses at a gentle pace.  Hatha literally means the sun and the moon. It reflects the union of opposites. When you perform yoga, you try to unite your mind and body and bring them under your control. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Iyengar Yoga</h2>
				<p>
				Iyengar Yoga focuses on alignment of the body.  Iyengar yoga makes use of props such as straps, bolsters, wooden blocks, and sand bags.  Poses are held for a set duration. The purpose of this is for students to recognize the subtleties of each posture and to pay attention to their musculoskeletal system and body alignment.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
				<p>
				Vinyasa Yoga denotes a flowing kind of yoga, connecting the breath to the movements. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Kripalu Yoga</h2>
				<p>
				Kripalu Yoga focuses on the emotional state of the student, in addition to poses. This form of yoga is usually slow and while a posture is held emotional and spiritual blocks are released.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Sivananda Yoga</h2>
				<p>
				Sivananda Yoga includes 12 ‘asanas’, breathing techniques, meditative states and chanting of mantras. The yoga helps keep your body and mind in balance.
