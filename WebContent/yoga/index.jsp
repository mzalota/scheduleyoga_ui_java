				"Yoga is the process in which we are able to access and abide in the profound vision of our true essential self nature (swarupa) by allowing the disturbances, fluctuations, agitations, perturbations, and vagaries (vrtti in Sanskrit) of consciousness (citta) to subside, become stilled, and eventually cease (nirodha)"

				<i>  Patanjali, from the "Yoga Sutras", Chapter I verses 2-3 </i>
